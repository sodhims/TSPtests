Hexaly Optimizer
----------------

Hexaly Optimizer is a new kind of mathematical optimization solver. It combines
different optimization technologies to solve your problem at hand. Using
Hexaly, you can now tackle ultra-large, real-life, discrete, numerical, or
even black-box problems in a model-and-run fashion without any tuning. Because
efficiency is nothing without reliability and robustness, we ensure our clients
the best quality of products and services thanks to a drastic continuous
integration methodology coupled with a responsive and dedicated support.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Hexaly Optimizer is via pip. If pip is available on
your system, simply open a terminal and enter the following command::

    pip install hexaly -i https://pip.hexaly.com

Note that the pip package does not contain the documentation and the examples.
If you want to install them on your computer (they are also available online),
you need to download the complete Hexaly distribution available on
`our official website <https://www.hexaly.com/download>`_.
